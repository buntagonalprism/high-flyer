Open ended VR experience, about emotions.
Do we want to start making Game Breaking Bugs? not going to be much emotion in it. Would this be a good VR game?
Can make a joyous physics and particle effects emitter game, pre-cursor to the Whirling Wizards (vr controllers used to cast spells in wizard duels)
