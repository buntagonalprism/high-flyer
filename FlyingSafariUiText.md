## Flying Safari
As an eccentric inventor you have been constructing a flying machine from the plans of Leonardo da Vinci. Now that your machine is complete, you can experience the joys of flight while also pursuing your passion for photography. 

There are nine different types of animals to find and photograph in the varied environments of the safari park. You'll have to explore thoroughly and keep a sharp eye out to find them all before you land!

## Photography Controls
Press down on the touchpad of the left controller to deploy your head-mounted camera. Time will slow to allow you to take the best show by pointing your h ead. Press down on the touchpad of the right controller to take a photo. 

Press the left controller touchpad again to put the camera away. You'll get the chance to see all your photos once you land on the other side of the park. 

## Enter the Machine
Explaining how to flying your amazing contraption will be best done from inside the machine itself. 

But how do you get out of this room? There's no door! Please stand in the centre of the grey square, and press the GO button to find out what will happen next... 

## Flying Machine - Turning
The flying machine is controlled by the wheel in front of you. As the wheel is turned, the flying machine will start to roll. The more it the flying machine is rolled, the faster it will turn left or right. 

When the wheel is level and the arrows line up, the current roll and rate of turn will be maintained. To level the flying machine out to horizontal again you will need to correct by turning the other way.

## Flying Machine - Pitching
To pitch the flying machine up, pull the wheel towards you. To angle the machine downwards, push the steering wheel away from you. 

That's all there is to it - press LAUNCH when you're ready to go!
